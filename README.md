# JobMine-EZSearch

JobMine EZSearch was conceived from the belief that there are more efficient ways to search through JobMine jobs than clicking on each one.

Imagine that you wanted to apply to all jobs that required C++ skills. How would you search for these jobs using JobMine's current search system?
EZSearch is designed to meet that need. Simply type in C++ in the search bar and all jobs that require C++ will appear.

Features:
- Refined Search Mechanism: In addition to almost all of JobMineâ€™s search filters, JobMine EZSearch can also search by keywords, prioritized languages, or you can write your own SQL queries.
- Integrates with Short List: Add or remove jobs from your shortlist with a single click. A text file is also created showing all jobs you have added to shortlist.
- Open to Extension: Stores jobs from JobMine to a local database so that you can use the data to build your own applications.
- Fast and Functional: Once JobMine EZSearch has finished setting up the local database with all jobs, you can instantaneously* search through 3000+ jobs and view jobs without waiting for page loads
- Download Formats: Download all jobs in four file formats: .html, .csv, .json, and .txt
- GUI: A rich responsive display powered by Bootstrap.
- GNU GPL3 License: Play with the source code however you wish.

To set up JobMine EZSearch, run the setup.py file. Please enter your userid and password when prompted.
Make sure that you are not using JobMine when JobMine EZSearch setting up,  updating jobs, or add to/removing from the short list.
