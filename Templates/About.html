                <p>Imagine you were a .NET developer who wanted to apply to all jobs that require .NET knowledge.
                    <b>How would you go about finding all .NET jobs?</b>
                    Many job titles do not contain the words “.NET” and clicking on every job in Job Inquiry is likely not ideal (learned this the hard way, it was not pretty)

                    Using JobMine EZSearch, we can easily find all jobs that require .NET knowledge by typing in “.NET” in the keywords search bar.

                <h4>How do I create my own SQL queries?</h4>
                SQL Search automatically selects all columns from the table storing the jobs and you can simply type in the WHERE clause to find your queries
                (eg, location = ‘Toronto’ OR summary LIKE ‘%game%’). You can also press the ? button next to the SQL Search textbox for help on writing SQL queries

                <h4>What can I do with the database?</h4>
                The database contains a table with 14 columns that store information related to JobMine jobs.
                You can use the data and run analytics, display the jobs in different formats, find patterns in text, or even read through them before going to bed. Liberty exists.

                A fellow UWaterloo student who manually clicked on hundreds of jobs to find the ones he was looking for. Hopefully, nobody else has to go through that experience again.
